    "The idea is to run this scraper as an API to have it nice and handy. The scraper code needs to be adapted to Flask, and that is what we are going to do in this Jupyter notebook. We will understand how it will work in a file that we will call **app.py**.\n",

    "# Flask & HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a microframework for web development that allows us to create simple web apps. In this case, it can be used to create a simple web page that will serve as a method to deploy the Python script **scraper.py** in a simple and portable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, it's quite simple to understand and learn how to use. So in this step, we will understand how to create and deploy a web page based on Flask and using an *HTML template*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Create the API with Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Flask**: First, ensure that Flask is installed in your environment.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Create `app.py`**: This will be our main application file where we'll define our Flask routes and logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Routes**: Set up routes in `app.py` to handle different API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HTML Template**: Use an HTML template to display the results on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this, you'll have a functional web scraper deployed as an API, accessible via a web page where users can input game names and get price comparisons. Let's get started!\n"

    "Last cell code is the general syntax for a Flask App. We instantiate an app object from the Flask module. This is like the ground where we will build our wonderful app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what can we do with it? First, we need to understand a couple of key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Routes**: This defines the URL that the app could handle and which Python function will execute when accessing this URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **HTTP Methods**: These protocols like GET and POST are the \"common tongue\" between a web browser and servers. A simple way to see it is that we use \"GET\" to retrieve data from a server and \"POST\" to send data to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In Flask, the `request` object allows access to the data of the request that the user is sending. For example, through the web, it would send a GET or POST method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **The Index Function**: This function will be executed when the user tries to access the root route.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, the web page needs a form to be filled with the game that the user is interested in getting info about. Behind the scenes, the program will execute the scraper. So, our first step is receiving info from the web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that the first method to be constructed is a POST method from the user. We can just omit the part in *scraper.py* where we create a function to transform the input from the user into a proper URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we should start by developing a simple idea of how the webpage should look. But let's not worry about that right now.\n"
